The are two very simple twine apps here

# Engine Trouble Module

Uses the Tweego module parameter

PROBLEM: When I run the Twine game on Chrome browser, the JavaScript code can not find the Engine object.

# Engine Trouble

This does not use the module option of Tweego and has the .js file in the source directory.

PROBLEM: The Twine passage can not find the JavaScript function.

# Engine Namespace

This third example does not produce any errors, but the output in Twine story does ot reflect the change of passage to "Passage C".\\

The onscreen message explains that a web browser refresh is required.
