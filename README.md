The are two very simple twine apps here

# Engine Trouble Module

Uses the Tweego module parameter

PROBLEM: When I run the Twine game on Chrome browser, the JavaScript code can not find the Engine object.

# Engine Trouble

This does not use the module option of Tweego and has the .js file in the source directory.

PROBLEM: The Twine passage can not find the JavaScript function.
